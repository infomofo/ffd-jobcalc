FFD Character Planner
=====================

I wanted to learn [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and also just got into Final Fantasy Dimensions
on Android, so I thought this would be a good opportunity.  I couldn't find any online Job
calculators, so I thought I'd give it a try.

I am using Bootstrap so I also plan to make the site responsive to mobile devices.

This should be a purely client-side implementation of a job calculator for Final Fantasy Dimensions.
