{"name":"Ffd-jobcalc","tagline":"A Job Calculator for Final Fantasy Dimensions","body":"FFD Character Planner\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nI wanted to learn [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and also just got into Final Fantasy Dimensions\r\non Android, so I thought this would be a good opportunity.  I couldn't find any online Job\r\ncalculators, so I thought I'd give it a try.\r\n\r\nI am using Bootstrap so I also plan to make the site responsive to mobile devices.\r\n\r\nThis should be a purely client-side implementation of a job calculator for Final Fantasy Dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe tool is hosted at [Github](http://infomofo.github.com/ffd-jobcalc/v1/index.html)\r\n\r\n_Note: Most information is sourced from [GameFAQs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/iphone/672352-final-fantasy-dimensions/faqs)._\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use FFD Character Planner\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Select a character to get the list of eligible jobs\r\n2. Add points to the rows representing different jobs by clicking on the plus sign, or remove already spent levels by clicking on the minus sign.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\n* Selecting a character should update the url so that you can copy and paste and retrieve that character again.  Build to be added soon- i.e. /ffd-jobcalc/v1/index.html?character=2\r\n* Mobile responsive template for use on smaller screens\r\n\r\nFuture use cases\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n* Support bookmarking builds\r\n* Support linking to builds\r\n\r\nAPIs\r\n---------\r\n\r\n* api v1: /v1 - Initial character builder\r\n\r\nSources\r\n-------\r\n\r\n* [FFD FAQ/Walkthrough Version 1.30 by holyknight](http://www.gamefaqs.com/iphone/672352-final-fantasy-dimensions/faqs/65107)\r\n* [Ability Acquisition FAQ 1.1 by Sir Phoenix](http://www.gamefaqs.com/iphone/672352-final-fantasy-dimensions/faqs/66204#section30)","google":"UA-39217394-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
